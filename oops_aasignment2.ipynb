    "In Python, encapsulation is implemented using classes. Here are some key aspects of encapsulation and its role in OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Hiding: Encapsulation enables data hiding, which means that the internal state of an object is hidden from the outside world. \n",
    "This is typically achieved by making the attributes of a class private, meaning they cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Access Control: By encapsulating data within a class, you can control how it is accessed and modified. This is done by providing public methods, \n",
    "often called getters and setters, to access and modify the private attributes. These methods serve as interfaces through which external code \n",
    "interacts with the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity: Encapsulation promotes modularity by grouping related data and behavior into coherent units (classes). This makes the code easier \n",
    "to understand, maintain, and reuse, as each class represents a self-contained entity with well-defined responsibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information Hiding: Encapsulation allows you to hide the implementation details of a class from its users. This reduces complexity and makes \n",
    "it easier to reason about the code by focusing on what the class does rather than how it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation and Inheritance: Encapsulation works in conjunction with inheritance to provide a mechanism for building hierarchical \n",
    "relationships between classes. Subclasses inherit the encapsulated data and behavior of their parent classes, but they can also override or \n",
    "extend these features as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, encapsulation plays a crucial role in promoting the principles of abstraction, information hiding, and modularity in object-oriented \n",

    "Modularization: Abstraction promotes modular design by dividing a system into smaller, manageable units (classes or modules), each responsible for a specific aspect of functionality.

This modularization makes it easier to develop, test, and maintain individual components independently.\n",

    "Encapsulation of Complexity: Abstraction allows developers to encapsulate the complexity of a system within well-defined boundaries. By hiding the internal implementation details of objects behind clear interfaces, abstraction shields the rest of the codebase from unnecessary complexity. This encapsulation of complexity helps in isolating changes, reducing the risk of unintended side effects, and improving code maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Promotion of Reusability: Abstraction promotes code reuse by providing a mechanism for defining generic, reusable components that can be applied to different contexts or scenarios. By designing classes with clear interfaces and separating concerns, abstraction enables developers to create components that are decoupled from specific implementations. These reusable components can then be easily incorporated into different parts of the system, reducing duplication and improving overall code efficiency.\n",

    "Flexibility and Extensibility: Abstraction enhances the flexibility and extensibility of a system by enabling developers to introduce changes or extend functionality without affecting the existing codebase.

This flexibility enables developers to replace or extend components seamlessly, making the system more adaptable to changing requirements or environments.\n",
